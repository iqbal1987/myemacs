Spell correction:

Try installing minimal packages required to compile hunspell.
and try the following. If not install all the devel packages in cygwin pkg manager. and convert files with dos2unix.


Hunspell compilinging in cygwin: https://github.com/hunspell/hunspell
- Add all developer dependencies whn installingcygwin.
- use dos2unix to change terminal chars.
- then follow the steps in hunspell compiling process

find . -name \*.m4|xargs dos2unix
find . -name \*.ac|xargs dos2unix
find . -name \*.am|xargs dos2unix

if everything goes well ./configure will create a make file.

run make


src/tools contains the executable. 
src/tools/.libs also containts exe's. Emcas referes to /.libs/ and these exe s need extra dlls from cygwin. cyghunspell-1.7.0.dll

But to execute this exe, cygwin1.dll is required. 
Shared library cygstdc++-6.dll is also required.
plus a few others. see .libs comment below. more dependencies are erequired. emacs looks at .lins somehow.

Instead of placeing a path variable in environment (for safety)
Copy the dll in tools directory. and refer to thei tools directory to emacs ispell-program-name parameter.

------


ispell-check-version shows the error hunspell inside tools/.libs was being used. even when the exec path was given as /tools/
cyghunspell-1.7-0.dll is required. install with cygwill libhunspell1.7. and copy the dll from cygwin bin folder to hunspell.libs folder.



----------------

ispell.el copied from Emacs26.x 
Now it works.
but ispell-change-dictionary has to be evoked beore flyspell mode.
